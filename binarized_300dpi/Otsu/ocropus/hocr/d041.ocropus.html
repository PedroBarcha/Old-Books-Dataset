<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 46 1764 1091 1803'>bottom of the stair and felt a little reassured. They</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 45 1712 1091 1753'>then saw that the passage turned sharply back on itself</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 46 1662 1091 1702'>and led in a step or two to a door. It was of very stout</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 46 1612 1091 1652'>oak and plated with iron. They opened it and found</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 45 1562 1092 1601'>that it had eight great iron bolts that could be shut on</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 45 1512 1092 1551'>that side, Within was a second door eqnally strong</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 45 1461 1093 1502'>and, on opening that, they found themselves in the secret</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 44 1412 1091 1451'>room itself. It was a long apartment only about eight</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 44 1361 1091 1401'>feet high, and was panelled throughout with oak. There</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 45 1310 1090 1351'>was a large and beautiful stone fireplace, above which</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 44 1260 1091 1300'>was the inscription,--''LLet there be no fire herein save</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 42 1217 551 1250'>that the fires above be lit,''</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 86 1160 1092 1199'>''That must be in case the smoke should show,'' said</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 44 1109 1092 1149'>Aline; ''how eareful they have been with every little</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 46 1059 188 1098'>thing !''</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 86 1010 1092 1048'>The room. was thiek with dust and obviously had not</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 44 958 1091 998'>been entered for many many years, Even if the</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 45 907 1092 947'>present occupants of Eolwick knew of the secret room</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 46 857 1092 896'>at all, whieh probably they did not, it was elear that they</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 44 806 1092 846'>never made any use of their knowledge. There was a</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 46 757 1092 796'>magnificent old oak bed in one corner but some of the</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 48 706 1093 745'>bedding was moth-eaten and destroyed. There were</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 47 655 1093 696'>also many little conveniences in the room, amongst other</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 45 604 1093 644'>things a small book-case containing several books. On</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 46 554 1093 594'>the whole it was a distinetly pleasant apartment despite</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 45 505 1092 544'>the absence of any visible windows. There were even</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 46 454 1090 493'>one or two pictures on the walls. In one corner on the</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 46 403 1093 442'>outer wall was a door, whieh the children opened, and</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 45 352 1093 393'>which clearly led to the underground passage below the</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 47 303 1092 342'>moat; but they decided not to esamine any more that</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 48 251 1093 294'>night. So they made their way up the stairs again back</span><br />
<span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 48 209 309 242'>to their room.</span><br />
