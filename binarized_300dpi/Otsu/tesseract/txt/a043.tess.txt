called a powerful nation. For almost as long they have possessed no independent country of
their own. For six hundred years their ancient capital city of Ani has stood a splendid but
empty rain in the desert between Kai's and the great mountain of Alago'z, which confronts
Ararat, with nearly equal height. They have been rent asunder and tormented by Persians,
'l‘urks, Tartars, and Russians in turn. Even their religion is not nationalistic or distinctly
separate from other forms of religion, like the Jewish. Except for metaphysical shades of
diti'erenee, hardly comprehensible to the modern world, there is little to distinguish it from the
orthodox Christianity of the Near East. Yet, through innumerable disasters and attempts
at extermination, the race persists, like the Jews, with astonishing vitality, unmistakable in
characteristics which may not be exactly heroic, but lead to aeertaiu material success. After
all, it is only in harassed and persecuted nationalities that true patriotism ever survives.

MATTHEVOSE EZ MERLIAN.

Catholieos and Supreme Patriarch of
Etehmiatzin. A man of high character and
great ability, also a distinguished linguist.
As Patriarch of Constantinople he was fami-
liarly known as the “ Iron Patriarch.” Banished
by the Hamidian Government, he returned
from exile in 1908 and was shortly after elected
Catholieos of Etch miatzin.

The Armenian Catholicos is not infallible
like the Pope. He is elected by the nation,
but his appointment is subject to the sanction

of the Czar.
