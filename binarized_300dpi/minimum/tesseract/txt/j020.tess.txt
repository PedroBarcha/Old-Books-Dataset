After the area is caned the strips are ﬁtted and glued in. Use little
glue. Tap the splines ﬁrmly with a mallet used over a block of

The size of the holes and the distance between them is deter-

cane used. Some prefer coarse
meshed areas, while others desire
them closely woven. There is,
however, what we may term a
standard mesh. The individual
may vary the dimensions given to

early caning was invariably of
coarse mesh.

split of cane being used diagonally than horizontally and vertically.
Both effects are pleasing.
