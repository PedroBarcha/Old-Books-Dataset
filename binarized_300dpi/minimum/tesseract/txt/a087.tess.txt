Since the time of Gregor3, Christianity has been the national religion
ofthe Armenians, and they have clung to their ch1istian faith througho un-
remitting persecutions and mart3rdon1s such as no othet christian people
ha\ c been called upon to endure.

'I he cathedral of Etchmiatzin built by G1egory still stands to- day, ' it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part or other, until perhaps
little of the original building 111a3 be left, but it still claims to be the church
builtby the pat1o11sa1nt of Armenia. I shall here quote a passage from
“Historical Sketch of the A1111enian Church,” written by an Armenian
pr'iest .

”Owing to political circumstances the Armenian Patriarchate had at
times to be transferred to metropolises and to other principal towns of
Armenia. In the year AD. 452 it was removed to Dwin, in 993 to Ani,
in II 14 to Romklah, and in 1294 to Sis. The Kingdom of Cilicia becoming
extinct, and, we having no more a kingdom and no longer a capital town, it
was natural and proper to re-transfer the See to its own original place, as
the entire nation unanimously desired it. Accordingly, in the year 1441, it
was decided by an ecclesiastical meeting that the seat of the Catholicus should
return to Holy Etchmiatzin, where to this day has been preserved the
proper unbroken succession from our Apostles and from our holy Father,
St. Gregory the Illuminator."

I read the other day in one of the foreign papers published in Japan,
the following piece of news

“ An Armenian Church pronounced by experts to date from the second
century of the Christian era, has been discovered in a fair state of preserva-
tion in the neighbourhood of Bash—Aparnah.”

Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light 011 Armenian history.
